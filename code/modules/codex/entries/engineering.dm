	mechanics_text = "When energized by a laser (or something hitting it), it emits radiation and heat.  If the heat reaches above 7000 kelvin, it will send an alert and start taking damage. \
	After integrity falls to zero percent, it will delaminate, causing a massive explosion, station-wide radiation spikes, and hallucinations. \
	Supermatter reacts badly to oxygen in the atmosphere.  It'll also heat up really quick if it is in vacuum.<br>\
	<br>\
	Supermatter cores are extremely dangerous to be close to, and requires protection to handle properly.  The protection you will need is:<br>\
	Optical meson scanners on your eyes, to prevent hallucinations when looking at the supermatter.<br>\
	Radiation helmet and suit, as the supermatter is radioactive.<br>\
	<br>\
	Touching the supermatter will result in *instant death*, with no corpse left behind!  You can drag the supermatter, but anything else will kill you."
	antag_text = "Exposing the supermatter to oxygen or vacuum will cause it to start rapidly heating up.  Sabotaging the supermatter and making it explode will \
	cause a period of lag as the explosion is processed by the server, as well as irradiating the entire station and causing hallucinations to happen.  \
	Wearing radiation equipment will protect you from most of the delamination effects sans explosion."

	associated_paths = list(/obj/machinery/power/apc)
	mechanics_text = "An APC (Area Power Controller) regulates and supplies backup power for the area they are in. Their power channels are divided \
	out into 'environmental' (Items that manipulate airflow and temperature), 'lighting' (the lights), and 'equipment' (Everything else that consumes power).  \
	Power consumption and backup power cell charge can be seen from the interface, further controls (turning a specific channel on, off or automatic, \
	toggling the APC's ability to charge the backup cell, or toggling power for the entire area via master breaker) first requires the interface to be unlocked \
	with an ID with Engineering access or by one of the station's robots or the artificial intelligence."

	antag_text = "This can be emagged to unlock it.  It will cause the APC to have a blue error screen. \
	Wires can be pulsed remotely with a signaler attached to it.  A powersink will also drain any APCs connected to the same wire the powersink is on."
