In such a case, it's possible they'll resume play soon or at a later time. These players are referred as \"going SSD\" or otherwise being SSD.<br><br>\
	\
	If the message displays something more severe, like being completely comatose or having a full system failure, the player has voluntarily ghosted while still alive - this means that the character won't return back to the round as a player, short of invervention from an admin. For clarity, these cases will also always mention that the player won't be recovering or waking up any time soon.<br><br>\
